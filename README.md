This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and document intelligence services using Azure AI and GPT-4 Vision. The guide is divided into three main sections, each covered in a separate Jupyter notebook.

- **[OCR with Azure AI Document Intelligence](./01-ocr-document-intelligence.ipynb)**
    - Overview of Azure's Document Analysis Client
    - Custom logic for processing extracted information
    - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM)

- **[OCR with GPT-4 Vision](./02-ocr-gpt4v.ipynb)**
    - Conversion of PDF documents into images
    - Text recognition and extraction from images using GPT-4 Vision
    - Context-aware text generation with `AzureOpenAIAssistant`

- **[Azure AI Indexer Orchestration](./03-azure-ai-search-orchestration.ipynb)**
    - Operation of indexers, skillsets, and skills for data ingestion, enrichment, and searchability
