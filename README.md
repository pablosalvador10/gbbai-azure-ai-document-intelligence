# üéØ Project Overview

This project showcases the implementation of advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and document intelligence services using Azure AI and GPT-4 Vision. The guide is divided into three main sections, each covered in a separate Jupyter notebook.

### Azure Document Intelligence üìÑ

Azure Document Intelligence goes beyond traditional OCR capabilities, leveraging AI and machine learning models to analyze, understand, and categorize extracted data. It processes unstructured data to detect entities, relationships, sentiments, and context, transforming raw data into structured, actionable insights. This empowers businesses to automate document-related workflows, enhance decision-making, and improve overall efficiency.

### Multimodal Capabilities with GPT-4 and Azure OpenAI üåê

GPT-4's multimodal capabilities signify its ability to understand and generate information across different modes of input, including text and images. This groundbreaking advancement allows for a more nuanced interpretation of documents, where GPT-4 can analyze visual elements in conjunction with textual content to grasp the context, intent, and subtleties of the information presented.

### Achieving Context-aware Data Extraction üéØ

The integration of Complex OCR with GPT-4‚Äôs multimodal capabilities, facilitated by Azure OpenAI, enables context-aware data extraction. This integration allows the system to:

- Extract data from complex documents using OCR, recognizing varied data types and structures.
- Understand and interpret this data in a nuanced way through Document Intelligence, identifying key elements such as entities and their relationships.
- Leverage GPT-4's multimodal input capabilities to analyze both the text and visual components of a document, offering insights or actions based on a comprehensive understanding of the content.

This approach not only enhances the accuracy of data extraction but also enables the system to make inferences, predictions, and decisions that closely mimic human judgment. It can transform how businesses process documents, from simple text extraction to understanding the deeper meaning and context behind the information, enabling more intelligent and automated decision-making processes.

## üìö Notebooks

1. **OCR with Azure AI Document Intelligence** (01-ocr-document-intelligence.ipynb)
    - Provides an overview of Azure's Document Analysis Client and its pre-trained models for document analysis.

2. **OCR with GPT-4 Vision** (02-ocr-gpt4v.ipynb)
    - Explores the use of GPT-4V(Vision) for OCR, presenting a more human-like approach to OCR that doesn't just extract text but also gathers contextualized details from the image.

3. **OCR with Invoices** (03-ocr-invoices.ipynb)
    - Demonstrates the strategic use of OCR for automating the extraction of key information from a diverse collection of invoices, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in processing financial documents.
