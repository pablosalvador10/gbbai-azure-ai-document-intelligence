    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-read'`: This model extracts both print and handwritten text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-tax'`: This model is designed to process US tax documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-invoice'`: This model automates the processing of invoices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-receipt'`: This model scans sales receipts for key data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-id'`: This model processes identity documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-businesscard'`: This model extracts information from business cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-contract'`: This model analyzes contractual agreements.\n",

    "- `'prebuilt-healthinsurancecard'`: This model processes health insurance cards.\n",

    "In addition to these pre-trained models, Azure also offers custom and composed models. For more details, refer to the [Azure Document Intelligence Model Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/concept-model-overview?view=doc-intel-4.0.0).\n",
