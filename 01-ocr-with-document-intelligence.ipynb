      "DVC6200 digital valve controllers (figures 1-1 and 1-2) are communicating, microprocessor-based current-to-pneumatic instruments. In addition to the traditional function of converting an input current signal to a pneumatic output pressure, the DVC6200 digital valve controller, using the HARTÂ® communications protocol, gives easy access to information critical to process operation. You can gain information from the principal component of the process, the control valve itself, using the handheld communicator at the valve, or at a field junction box, or by using a\n",

Its purpose is to effectively isolate the control system output from modulated HART communication signals and raise the impedance of the control system to allow HART communication.

      "\n",
      "The Auxiliary Input Terminals of a DVC6200 with instrument level ODV can be used with a locally-mounted switch for initiating a partial stroke test. Some applications require that the switch be installed remotely from the DVC6200.\n",
      "\n",
      "The length for wiring connected to the Auxiliary Input Terminals is limited by capacitance. For proper operation of the Auxiliary Input Terminals capacitance should not exceed 100,000 pF. As with all control signal wiring, good wiring practices should be observed to minimize adverse effect of electrical noise on the Aux Switch function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example Calculation: Capacitance per foot or per meter is required to calculate the length of wire that may be connected to the Aux switch input. The wire should not exceed the capacitance limit of 100,000 pF. Typically the wire manufacturer supplies a data sheet which provides all of the electrical properties of the wire. The pertinent parameter is the highest possible capacitance. If shielded wire is used, the appropriate number is the \"Conductor to Other Conductor & Shield\" value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example - 18AWG Unshielded Audio, Control and Instrumentation Cable\n",

      "\n",
      "The AUX switch input passes less than 1 mA through the switch contacts, and uses less than 5V, therefore, neither the resistance nor the voltage rating of the cable are critical.

      "The HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer) protocol gives field devices the capability of communicating instrument and process data digitally. This digital communication occurs over the same two-wire loop that provides the 4-20 mA process control signal, without disrupting the process signal. In this way, the analog process signal, with its faster update rate, can be used for control. At the same time, the HART protocol allows access to digital diagnostic, maintenance, and additional process data. The protocol provides total system integration via a host device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The HART protocol uses frequency shift keying (FSK). Two individual frequencies of 1200 and 2200 Hz are superimposed over the 4-20 mA current signal. These frequencies represent the digits 1 and 0 (see figure A-1). By superimposing a frequency signal over the 4-20 mA current, digital communication is attained. The average value of the HART signal is zero, therefore no DC value is added to the 4-20 mA signal. Thus, true simultaneous communication is achieved without interrupting the process signal.\n",

The module base contains the following submodules: I/P converter, printed wiring board (pwb) assembly, and pneumatic relay. The relay position is detected by sensing the magnet on the relay beam via a detector on the printed wiring board. This sensor is used for the minor loop feedback (MLFB) reading. The module base can be rebuilt by replacing the submodules. See figures A-3, A-4, A-5, and A-6.\n",

      "DVC6200 digital valve controllers are loop-powered instruments that provide a control valve position proportional to an input signal from the control room. The following describes a double-acting digital valve controller mounted on a piston actuator.\n",
      "\n",
      "The input signal is routed into the terminal box through a single twisted pair of wires and then to the printed wiring board assembly submodule where it is read by the microprocessor, processed by a digital algorithm, and converted into an analog I/P drive signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the input signal increases, the drive signal to the I/P converter increases, increasing the I/P output pressure. The I/P output pressure is routed to the pneumatic relay submodule. The relay is also connected to supply pressure and amplifies the small pneumatic signal from the I/P converter. The relay accepts the amplified pneumatic signal and provides two output pressures. With increasing input (4 to 20 mA signal), the output A pressure always increases and the output B pressure decreases. The output A pressure is used for double-acting and single-acting direct applications. The output B pressure is used for double-acting and single-acting reverse applications. As shown in figure A-3, A-4, and A-5 the increased output A pressure causes the actuator stem to move downward. Stem position is sensed by the non-contact travel feedback sensor. The stem continues to move downward until the correct stem position is attained. At this point the printed wiring board assembly stabilizes the I/P drive signal. This positions the flapper to prevent any further increase in nozzle pressure.\n",
