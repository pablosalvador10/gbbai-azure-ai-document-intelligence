    "Azure's Document Analysis Client provides a variety of pre-trained models that can be used to analyze documents. The `analyze_document` function takes in a document (either a URL or a file path) and the type of pre-trained model to use for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of the available pre-trained models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-layout'`: This is the default model. It extracts text, tables, selection marks, and structure elements from the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-document'`: This model is used for generic document understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-read'`: This model extracts both print and handwritten text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-tax'`: This model is designed to process US tax documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-invoice'`: This model automates the processing of invoices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-receipt'`: This model scans sales receipts for key data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-id'`: This model processes identity documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-businesscard'`: This model extracts information from business cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-contract'`: This model analyzes contractual agreements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'prebuilt-healthinsurancecard'`: This model processes health insurance cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these pre-trained models, Azure also offers custom and composed models. For more details, refer to the [Azure Document Intelligence Model Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/concept-model-overview?view=doc-intel-4.0.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `analyze_document` function returns the analysis result, which can then be used for further processing or analysis."

      "## WARNING\n",
      "\n",
      "Always wear protective gloves, clothing, and eyewear when performing any installation operations to avoid personal injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal injury or equipment damage caused by sudden release of pressure may result if the valve assembly is installed where service conditions could exceed the limits given in table 1 or on the appropriate nameplates. To avoid such injury or damage, provide a relief valve for over-pressure protection as required by government or accepted industry codes and good engineering practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process media.\n",
      "\n",
      "If installing into an existing application, also refer to the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section in this instruction manual.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## CAUTION\n",
      "\n",
      "When ordered, the valve configuration and construction materials were selected to meet particular pressure, temperature, pressure drop, and controlled fluid conditions. Responsibility for the safety of process media and compatibility of valve materials with process media rests solely with the purchaser and end-user. Since some valve body/trim material combinations are limited in their pressure drop and temperature ranges, do not apply any other conditions to the valve without first contacting your Emerson sales office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before installing the valve, inspect the valve and pipelines for any damage and any foreign material which may cause product damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\\. Before installing the valve, inspect the valve and associated equipment for any damage and any foreign material.\n",
      "\n",
      "2\\. Make certain the valve body interior is clean, that pipelines are free of foreign material, and that the valve is oriented so that pipeline flow is in the same direction as the arrow on the side of the valve.\n",
      "\n",
      "3\\. The control valve assembly may be installed in any orientation unless limited by seismic criteria. However, the normal method is with the actuator vertical above the valve. Other positions may result in uneven valve plug and cage wear, and improper operation. With some valves, the actuator may also need to be supported when it is not vertical. For more information, consult your Emerson sales office.\n",
      "\n",
      "4\\. Use accepted piping and welding practices when installing the valve in the line. For flanged valves, use a suitable gasket between the valve and pipeline flanges.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## CAUTION\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on valve body materials used, post weld heat treating may be required. If so, damage to internal elastomeric and plastic parts, as well as internal metal parts is possible. Shrink-fit pieces and threaded connections may also loosen. In general, if post weld heat treating is to be performed, all trim parts should be removed. Contact your Emerson sales office for additional information.\n",
      "\n",
      "5\\. With a leak-off bonnet construction, remove the pipe plugs (keys 14 and 16, figure 14) to hook up the leak-off piping. If continuous operation is required during inspection or maintenance, install a three-valve bypass around the control valve assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6\\. If the actuator and valve are shipped separately, refer to the actuator mounting procedure in the appropriate actuator instruction manual.\n",

      "## WARNING\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal injury could result from packing leakage. Valve packing was tightened prior to shipment; however, the packing might require some readjustment to meet specific service conditions. Check with your process or safety engineer for any additional measures that must be taken to protect against process media.\n",
      "\n",
      "Valves with ENVIRO-SEAL live-loaded packing or HIGH-SEAL live-loaded packing will not require this initial readjustment. See the Fisher instruction manuals, ENVIRO-SEAL Packing System for Sliding-Stem Valves or HIGH-SEAL Live-Loaded Packing System (as appropriate), for packing instructions. If you wish to convert your present packing arrangement to ENVIRO-SEAL packing, refer to the retrofit kits listed in the Parts Kits section.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Maintenance\n",
      "\n",
      "Valve parts are subject to normal wear and must be inspected and replaced as necessary. Inspection and maintenance frequency depends on the severity of service conditions. This section includes instructions for packing lubrication, packing maintenance, trim maintenance, and ENVIRO-SEAL bellows seal bonnet replacement. All maintenance operations may be performed with the valve in the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## WARNING\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid personal injury or property damage from sudden release of process pressure or bursting of parts. Before performing any maintenance operations:\n",
      "\n",
      ". Do not remove the actuator from the valve while the valve is still pressurized.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Always wear protective gloves, clothing, and eyewear when performing any maintenance operations to avoid personal injury.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Disconnect any operating lines providing air pressure, electric power, or a control signal to the actuator. Be sure the actuator cannot suddenly open or close the valve.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Use bypass valves or completely shut off the process to isolate the valve from process pressure. Relieve process pressure from both sides of the valve. Drain the process media from both sides of the valve.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Vent the pneumatic actuator loading pressure and relieve any actuator spring precompression.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Use lock-out procedures to be sure that the above measures stay in effect while you work on the equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      ". The valve packing box may contain process fluids that are pressurized, even when the valve has been removed from the pipeline. Process fluids may spray out under pressure when removing the packing hardware or packing rings, or when loosening the packing box pipe plug.\n",

      "\n",
      "## CAUTION\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow instructions carefully to avoid damaging the product surfaces, which could result in damage to the product. Trim Cartridge is a single use repair solution. It is not recommended to remove and reinstall Trim Cartridge after initial installation so valve assemblies with Trim Cartridge will not support an open and inspect maintenance strategy. If the valve contains Trim Cartridge (Trim Cartridges can be identified by a name plate on the bonnet flange, the use of a packing nut, and \"Fisher\" embossed below the yoke mounting), please refer to Fisher ET and EZ easy-e Valves with Trim Cartridge Instruction Manual (D104358X012) for appropriate maintenance procedures.\n",

      "\n",
      "To avoid personal injury or property damage resulting from fire or explosion, do not lubricate packing used in oxygen service or in processes with temperatures over 260℃ (500°F).\n",
      "\n",
      "If a lubricator or lubricator/isolating valve (figure 2) is provided for PTFE/composition or other packings that require lubrication, it will be installed in place of the pipe plug (key 14, figure 14). Use a good quality silicon-base lubricant. Do not lubricate packing used in oxygen service or in processes with temperatures over 260℃ (500°F). To operate the lubricator, simply turn the cap screw clockwise to force the lubricant into the packing box. The lubricator/isolating valve operates the same way except open the isolating valve before turning the cap screw and then close the isolating valve after lubrication is completed.\n",

      "\n",
      "For spring-loaded single PTFE V-ring packing, the spring (key 8) maintains a sealing force on the packing. If leakage is noted around the packing follower (key 13), check to be sure the shoulder on the packing follower is touching the bonnet. If the shoulder is not touching the bonnet, tighten the packing flange nuts (key 5, figure 14) until the shoulder is against the bonnet. If leakage cannot be stopped in this manner, proceed to the Replacing Packing procedure.\n",

      "If the packing is relatively new and tight on the stem, and if tightening the packing flange nuts does not stop the leakage, the valve stem may be worn or nicked so that a seal cannot be made. The surface finish of a new valve stem is critical for making a good packing seal. If the leakage comes from the outside diameter of the packing, the leakage may be caused by nicks or scratches around the packing box wall. If performing any of the following procedures, inspect the valve stem and packing box wall for nicks and scratches.\n",

      "\n",
      "Refer to the WARNING at the beginning of the Maintenance section in this instruction manual.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\\. Isolate the control valve from the line pressure, release pressure from both sides of the valve, and drain the process media from both sides of the valve. If using a power actuator, also shut off all pressure lines to the power actuator, and release all pressure from the actuator. Use lock-out procedures to be sure that the above measures stay in effect while you work on the equipment.\n",

      "2\\. Disconnect the operating lines from the actuator and any leak-off piping from the bonnet. Disconnect the stem connector, then remove the actuator from the valve by unscrewing the yoke locknut (key 15, figure 14) or the hex nuts (key 26, figure 14).\n",
      "\n",
      "3\\. Loosen the packing flange nuts (key 5, figure 14) so that the packing is not tight on the valve stem. Remove any travel indicator parts and stem locknuts from the valve stem threads.\n",

      "## WARNING\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid personal injury or property damage caused by uncontrolled movement of the bonnet, loosen the bonnet by following the instructions in the next step. Do not remove a stuck bonnet by pulling on it with equipment that can stretch or store energy in any other manner.
