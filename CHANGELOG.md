## [1.0.0] - 2024-06-03

### Added
- **Implementation Notebooks**: Added three notebooks for the implementation of OCR using GPT-4 Vision and Document Intelligence. These notebooks demonstrate the strategic use of OCR for automating the extraction of key information from a diverse collection of invoices, thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy in processing financial documents. The notebooks explore OCR with Document Intelligence using the `prebuilt-..` model, expand the approach with GPT-4 + Vision for a more human-like OCR experience, and conduct a quantitative comparison to evaluate the performance of both methods against the ground truth.
